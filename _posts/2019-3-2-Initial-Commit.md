Finally - a use for my personal domain name bought since - wow, 2010 but never used.

Potential topics I may or may not cover here:

- Programming
- Software Engineering
- Side projects
- Ideas

... depending on what I feel like.

Here's some code:

```scala
object Hello{
    def main(Array[String]): Unit = {
        println("Hello, World")
    }
}
```

And the [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation):

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$
