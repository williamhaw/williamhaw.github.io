Last weekend I created a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) and submitted it to the GitHub Hackathon. It was a relatively simple workflow that brings up a [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) API for tests to run against.

It was pretty cool as I hadn't had a chance to write a Node application before. (The other way to write an Action is to build a Docker image, in which case any language can be used.)

In this post, I'm going to ~~share my thought process~~ bemoan my follies as I went about writing the Action.

Action repository: [https://github.com/williamhaw/setup-wiremock-action](https://github.com/williamhaw/setup-wiremock-action "https://github.com/williamhaw/setup-wiremock-action")

Tl;dr In JavaScript, use async await to deal with intermediate state, much simpler. Also, just having documentation from types make TypeScript awesome, even if you don't write your application in TypeScript.

<!--excerpt-->

# Pseudocode

1. Download the WireMock jar.
2. Copy stubs (request and response definitions) to folders read by WireMock when it starts.
3. Start WireMock in the background.
4. Ping WireMock (to make sure it has started).
5. Run test command.
6. Cleanup
   1. Kill WireMock
   2. Get the WireMock logs (these contain request mismatches, very important when debugging).
   3. Delete copied stubs.
   4. Tell Github if this run failed.

I started out stubbing all the functions and deciding on their inputs and output. I noticed:

* To start WireMock, I need the path where I downloaded it to.
* To kill the WireMock process, I need the process object from when I start it.
* To tell GitHub that the job failed, I need the status from pinging WireMock and from running the test command.
* These steps need to run in the order above.

What all these have in common is that these steps take state that is not from the immediately preceding step.

At this point I could either store the required values in global state or find an abstraction that allows me to be able to retrieve state that needs to span across multiple steps.

I read up on Javascript Promises and realized that I could use a chain of Promises to enforce the execution order without maintaining global state. Just one problem:

```javascript
//promises are chained like this
promiseReturningFunctionOne() //say this returns an object
  .then(promiseReturningFunctionTwo) //this function takes one input and returns a Promise
  .then(state => promiseReturningFunctionThree(state)) // this is more explicit passing of state
  .then({myValue} => promiseReturningFunctionThree(myValue)) //to extract one value out of the preceeding state
  .catch(e => {console.error(e)}) // handle all errors, processing stops at the first function that throws an error
```

The state that each function gets is from the one immediately preceding it; that `state` object is _not_ the same as the one wrapping `myValue`.

After thinking about it, I came up with something like this:

```javascript
downloadWireMock()
  .then(state => {
    copyStubs(); //perform side effect, doesn't return any value
    return state;
  })
  .then(state => {
    const wiremockProcessState = startWireMock(state.wireMockPath);
    //merge state so that later functions have access
    return {
      ...state,
      ...wiremockProcessState
    }
  })
  .then(state => {console.log(`State after WireMock started: ${state}`)})
  ...
```

# The Good

* It's vanilla JavaScript (ES6).
* It extracts the state handling and organises the main logic as a flow. The structure of the app can be understood by reading top to bottom.
* Values in the state object can only be accessed by later steps, earlier steps cannot accidentally access values produced by later steps.
* The various helper functions don't need to know about the rest of the flow.
* The entire state of the application can be easily logged by sticking a `then` clause in between any two steps (second-last line above).
* Error handling only needs to be handled once at the end of the chain.

# The Bad

* There's a lot of boilerplate. Instead of one line to add a function to the chain, it's 3-4 lines. For every function.
* Every non side-effecting function needs to return an object so that it can be merged into the previous state.
* I can't use functions that return promises, I need the actual values to be put in the state. Technically I _can_, but that would make it really confusing; which value do I need to await on?
* The keys for the values present in the state object are not defined in a central location. I have to inspect the function that produces that value to know the name of its key. This breaks encapsulation.

# The Ugly

* Did I say boilerplate?

I wasn't really happy with this solution, but I thought it had its merits. Then I ~~started wondering~~ came to my senses and tried implementing it with async/await:

```javascript
(async function() {
  try{
    const wiremockPath = await downloadWireMock();
    copyStubs();
    var wiremockProcess = startWireMock(wireMockPath); //need hoisting to be referenced in the finally clause
    ...
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  } finally {
    killWireMock(wiremockProcess);
  }
})()
```

and it was much simpler. I realised that maybe the abstraction I needed all along were **statements**. Simple statements also have many of the good properties above and don't have the disadvantages of my approach ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. In particular:

1. You can't use a value _before_ it has been created.
2. Variables are scoped to the function they are declared in.
3. Can literally be read top to bottom.

To be clear, this is not a knock against promise chains. They are useful if the later parts of the chain only depend on the step immediately before. In my case I was able to reap the benefits of async/await because I benefited from the illusion that all my asynchronous functions were synchronous.

## Notes

* The development process was really smooth as I happened to use libraries that had Typescript interface declarations. I was surprised how much it helped to have easy IDE access to arguments and return values which I take for granted in Java and Scala. I think I'll try out writing in TypeScript in the near future.
* GitHub Actions runs really fast, fast enough to be an effective integration test for this Action. My test workflow took 30-40 seconds to complete, then I would move on to the next bit of functionality.
* I chose to implement this Action in Node as I felt that this Action should be cross-platform. Implementing it in a Docker container limits it to Linux runners.
